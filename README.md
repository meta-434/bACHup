# bACHup Project

Updates:
===================
v0.2a4(inc) - removed local backup options, pushed to later release. Current focus is on
backup and retrieval to and from remote AWS S3 bucket using boto3.

Next steps:
======================
1. Finish S3 bucket creation / upload and download based on user input and prefs.txt
2. implement compression library to reduce storage costs and simply backup and retrieval process.
